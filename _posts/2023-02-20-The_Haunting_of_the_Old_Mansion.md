The old abandoned house stood alone on the outskirts of town, a warning to all that nothing good comes from it. The locals whispered of a ghost that had haunted the house for centuries, but none dared step foot on the property for fear of the unknown.

It was late one night when a young couple decided to test their courage and explore the house. It felt wrong from the start, like a chill had settled over them and the darkness seemed to be alive. They slowly made their way through the rooms, the creaking of the floorboards causing them to jump at every sound. 

Suddenly they heard a voice, soft and eerie, calling out from the shadows. They froze in fear as the voice spoke again, this time louder, more menacing. It was then that they both saw it, a glowing figure standing in the hallway. It was the ghost, eyes wide with rage and a long white cloak draped around its body.

The couple ran, screaming in terror, as the ghost chased them out of the house. When they reached the safety of their car they looked back to see the ghost had disappeared. But they both knew that no one was safe from the spirit of the old abandoned house.
