Hans had been best friends with his neighbor, Steve, since they were kids. They had done everything together, from playing tag in the backyard to starting their own business. 

But then Steve started to act strange. He stopped returning Hans' calls, and when they did talk, he was evasive and distant. Hans had no idea why, but he was determined to find out.

One day, Hans decided to follow Steve to see what he was up to. What he discovered was shocking: Steve was meeting with a girl, and it was clear that the two of them were more than just friends. 

Hans was heartbroken. He had trusted Steve completely, and now he had been betrayed. He wanted to confront him, but he didn't know what to say.

In the end, Hans decided to take the high road. He wrote Steve a letter, telling him that he was hurt and disappointed, but that he still considered him a friend and wanted to work things out. 

When Steve received the letter, he was overcome with guilt. He knew he had been wrong to do what he did, and he apologized to Hans. The two of them talked it out and eventually reconciled, but the friendship was never quite the same again. 

Hans had been betrayed, but he had learned an important lesson: true friendship is more important than anything else.
