novel.

Once upon a time, in a vast green meadow, there stood a horse named Henry and a zebra named Ziggy. They were the best of friends and often spent their afternoons grazing and chatting about life.

One sunny afternoon, as they were munching on some grass, Henry turned to Ziggy and said, "Have you ever wondered if there's more to life than just grazing and running?"

Ziggy looked at his friend, intrigued. "What do you mean, Henry?"

"Well," Henry continued, "I mean, do you ever think about the deeper meanings of the universe? Like, why are we here? What's the purpose of our existence?"

Ziggy pondered for a moment before replying, "I suppose I have thought about it from time to time, but I never really dwelled on it. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Henry said, "I just feel like there has to be more to life than just eating and sleeping. There has to be some sort of greater purpose."

Ziggy nodded in agreement, and the two friends continued their conversation, delving deeper into the mysteries of the universe.

As they were discussing the concept of time and its never-ending nature, a sudden snorting sound interrupted them. They turned to see a plump little pig waddling towards them.

"Hey, what are you guys talking about?" the pig asked, his beady eyes gleaming with excitement.

Henry and Ziggy exchanged a wary glance before turning back to the pig. "We were just discussing the deeper meanings of the universe," Henry replied.

The pig's eyes widened in amazement. "Wow, that's deep! I've always wanted to write a novel about the mysteries of the universe. Can I join in on your conversation?"

Henry and Ziggy hesitated for a moment before reluctantly agreeing. They didn't want to hurt the pig's feelings, but they also didn't want to share their ideas with just anyone.

The pig eagerly joined in on the conversation, but it quickly became apparent that he didn't quite understand what they were talking about. He kept interrupting them with irrelevant questions and silly comments.

Henry and Ziggy tried their best to ignore him, but the pig was persistent. He kept prodding them for more information, trying to steal their ideas for his own novel.

Finally, Henry had had enough. "Listen, pig," he said sternly, "we're trying to have a serious conversation here. If you're not going to contribute anything meaningful, then I suggest you leave."

The pig looked hurt, but he knew deep down that Henry was right. He had been so caught up in trying to steal their ideas that he had lost sight of the real purpose of their conversation.

Feeling ashamed, the pig apologized and waddled away, leaving Henry and Ziggy to continue their conversation in peace.

As the sun began to set, Henry and Ziggy wrapped up their conversation, feeling satisfied with their newfound understanding of the universe. They realized that sometimes, it's important to take a step back and reflect on the bigger picture, rather than getting caught up in the mundane details of everyday life.

And as they settled down for the night, they knew that they would always have each other to turn to whenever they wanted to explore the mysteries of the universe once again.
