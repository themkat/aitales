Tristan had always been taught that the kingdom of Queldor was just and righteous. He had been trained as a knight from a young age, and his entire life had been dedicated to serving the kingdom. But as he rode through the forest on his way to the front lines of the war against the orcs, he couldn't help but wonder if he was on the right side.

He had heard stories of the atrocities committed by the human soldiers against the orcs. He had heard of villages burned to the ground, innocent civilians slaughtered in the streets, and prisoners tortured for information. He had always assumed that these were just rumors spread by the orcs to gain sympathy, but as he saw the devastation wrought by the human army firsthand, he began to question everything he had been taught.

Tristan's doubts only grew when he encountered an orc scout who had been captured by the human soldiers. The orc was badly wounded and barely conscious, but he managed to whisper a few words to Tristan before he died.

"The humans...they are...the real monsters...we...only want...to be free..."

Tristan couldn't shake the words from his mind. He knew that the orcs had been oppressed by the human kingdom for centuries, but he had always believed that it was for their own good. Now he wondered if he had been wrong all along.

As he rode through the forest, Tristan caught glimpses of the orc army moving through the trees. They were a formidable force, with warriors clad in armor made from the bones of their enemies and wielding weapons that glinted in the sun. Tristan had always been taught that the orcs were savage beasts, but as he watched them from a distance, he saw a discipline and unity that he had never witnessed in the human army.

Tristan knew that he had a decision to make. He could continue to fight for the human kingdom, blindly following orders and never questioning the morality of his actions. Or he could join forces with the orcs, fighting to overthrow the oppressive regime and bring freedom to a people who had been subjugated for far too long.

In the end, it was an encounter with an orc named Grommash that sealed Tristan's decision. Grommash was a fierce warrior, with scars crisscrossing his face and a fierce determination in his eyes. But he also had a wisdom and compassion that Tristan had never seen in a human.

As they stood facing each other across a battlefield, Grommash spoke to Tristan in a voice that was low and gravelly.

"Knight...you fight for a kingdom that does not deserve your loyalty. The humans have oppressed my people for centuries, but we will no longer bow to their tyranny. Join us, and fight for a cause that is just."

Tristan hesitated for only a moment before he made his decision. He lowered his sword and stepped forward, holding out his hand in a gesture of peace.

"I will fight with you, Grommash. I cannot in good conscience continue to fight for a kingdom that oppresses the innocent. Together, we can bring freedom to the orcs and create a new world where all are treated with dignity and respect."

Grommash clasped Tristan's hand in a firm grip, his eyes shining with a fierce determination.

"Together, we will bring down the kingdom of Queldor and create a new world. A world where orcs and humans can live together in peace and harmony."

And with those words, Tristan and Grommash led their armies into battle, fighting side by side against the oppressive human kingdom. It was a long and grueling war, with many lives lost on both sides. But in the end, the orcs emerged victorious, and Tristan stood with Grommash at the head of a new kingdom, one that was built on the principles of justice and equality.

Tristan knew that he had made the right decision. He had followed his heart and fought for a cause that was just, and he had helped to bring freedom to a people who had been oppressed for far too long. And as he looked out over the new kingdom, he knew that he would never again question whether he was on the right side.
