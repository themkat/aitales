Once upon a time, there was an older lady named Mrs. Jenkins who lived alone in a small cottage on the outskirts of a small town. Mrs. Jenkins was a sweet old lady who enjoyed spending her time gardening and reading books. She had a beautiful garden that was the envy of the town. One day, Mrs. Jenkins woke up to find a group of gnomes standing outside her window.

"Hello, Mrs. Jenkins," said the lead gnome.

Mrs. Jenkins was taken aback. She had never seen gnomes before.

"Who are you?" she asked.

"We're gnomes," said the lead gnome. "We've come to visit you."

"Why?" asked Mrs. Jenkins.

"We want to have a conversation with you," said the gnome.

Mrs. Jenkins hesitated for a moment but then decided to let the gnomes in. She had never had a conversation with gnomes before, and she was curious to see what they had to say.

The gnomes entered Mrs. Jenkins' cottage and sat down around her table.

"So, what do you want to talk about?" asked Mrs. Jenkins.

"Well, we've been having a deep conversation about the purpose of our existence," said the lead gnome.

"Oh, I see," said Mrs. Jenkins. "And what have you come up with?"

"We've come to the conclusion that our purpose is to bring joy and happiness to people's lives," said the gnome.

"That's a lovely purpose," said Mrs. Jenkins. "I can see that you bring joy to my garden."

"We try our best," said the gnome.

The conversation continued for a while, and Mrs. Jenkins was enjoying herself. She had never had such a deep conversation before. The gnomes were surprisingly intelligent and thoughtful.

As the conversation drew to a close, Mrs. Jenkins decided to ask the gnomes a question.

"So, what do you think about humans?" she asked.

The gnomes looked at each other and then back at Mrs. Jenkins.

"Well," said the lead gnome. "We think that humans are strange creatures. You're always rushing around, trying to do things, and you never seem to stop and enjoy the simple things in life."

"I see," said Mrs. Jenkins. "And what do you think about me?"

The gnomes looked at Mrs. Jenkins and then back at each other.

"We think that you're a lovely lady," said the lead gnome. "You have a beautiful garden, and you seem to enjoy the simple things in life. We like that about you."

Mrs. Jenkins smiled. She was happy to hear that the gnomes liked her.

As the gnomes prepared to leave, Mrs. Jenkins decided to ask them one more question.

"So, what's the most bizarre thing about you?" she asked.

The gnomes looked at each other and then back at Mrs. Jenkins.

"The most bizarre thing about us?" said the lead gnome. "Well, I suppose it's the fact that we can talk."

Mrs. Jenkins was surprised. She had never thought about the fact that gnomes could talk.

"And what's the most bizarre thing about you?" asked the gnome.

Mrs. Jenkins thought for a moment.

"Well," she said. "I suppose the most bizarre thing about me is that I talk to my plants."

The gnomes looked at each other and then back at Mrs. Jenkins.

"You talk to your plants?" said the lead gnome.

"Yes," said Mrs. Jenkins. "I believe that they have feelings and that they like to be talked to."

The gnomes were silent for a moment.

"Well," said the lead gnome. "I suppose we all have our quirks."

Mrs. Jenkins smiled. She was happy to have had such an interesting conversation with the gnomes.

As the gnomes left, Mrs. Jenkins couldn't help but wonder if she had just dreamed the whole thing. But then she looked out her window and saw the gnomes walking away, and she knew that it had really happened.

The reader may question whether they really wanted to learn about the deep conversations and bizarre quirks of gnomes and an older lady who talks to her plants. However, the story's humor and charm make it an enjoyable read nonetheless.
