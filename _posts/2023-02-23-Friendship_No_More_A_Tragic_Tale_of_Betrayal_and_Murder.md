It was a typical summer day in the small town of Maplewood. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the streets were bustling with activity. 

But for two friends, it was anything but typical. 

John and Sarah had been best friends since they were kids. They had grown up together, shared secrets, and had each other's backs no matter what. 

But today, something was different. 

John had been acting strange lately, and Sarah had noticed. He had been distant and withdrawn, and he had been spending more and more time away from her. 

When Sarah asked him what was wrong, he refused to tell her. He said it was nothing, but she knew something was wrong. 

That afternoon, Sarah decided to follow John. She followed him to a shady part of town, and watched as he met up with a group of shady-looking characters. She watched as they exchanged money and goods, and she knew something was up. 

She followed John back to his house, and when he went inside, she snuck in after him. She found him in his bedroom, counting a large stack of cash. 

John had been dealing drugs. 

Sarah was shocked and angry. She had trusted John, and he had betrayed her. She wanted to confront him, but she knew it wouldn't do any good. 

So instead, she left. She left without saying a word, and she never spoke to John again. 

After Sarah left John's house, she couldn't get the image of him counting the money out of her head. She was hurt, angry, and didn't know what to do.

A few weeks later, Sarah received a call from a mutual friend, telling her that John had been arrested for murder. He had been involved in a drug deal gone wrong, and things had escalated quickly. John had ended up killing someone in the process.

Sarah was in shock. She couldn't believe that her best friend had done something so horrible. She attended his trial, hoping to find some answers, but all she saw was a different person. John had become someone she didn't recognize. He was cold, distant, and unrepentant.

In the end, John was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Sarah never spoke to him again. She had lost her best friend, and the betrayal of trust was too great to forgive.

The experience changed Sarah forever. She learned that sometimes people can change, and that you can never be too careful when it comes to trusting others.
