It was a sunny day at the zoo, and the pandas, Mei and Yang, were lounging in their enclosure. Suddenly, they heard a commotion outside, and they saw a group of reporters and zoo visitors gathered at the edge of their exhibit.

Mei groaned. "Oh no, not this again."

Yang nodded in agreement. "I know, it's so exhausting. Every time we're in public, they act like we're in love."

The two pandas had been the subject of a media frenzy for months. It all started when Mei and Yang were caught on camera playing together, and the footage went viral. From there, rumors spread that the pandas were in a romantic relationship.

The press and public ate it up. They couldn't get enough of the adorable pandas and their supposed love story. Mei and Yang, on the other hand, were less than thrilled.

"It's not that I don't like you, Yang," Mei said, "but I don't like you like that."

Yang chuckled. "I know the feeling, Mei. I mean, you're great and all, but I'm not exactly looking for a mate right now."

Mei nodded. "Exactly. And even if we were interested in each other, it's not like we could act on it. We're brother and sister, for goodness sake."

Yang shuddered. "Ugh, don't even remind me. It's bad enough that we're stuck living together. I don't need people thinking we're in love too."

Mei rolled her eyes. "Tell me about it. It's like they can't fathom the idea of two animals just being friends."

Yang sighed. "I know. It's like they think we're a Disney movie come to life. Well, let me tell you, if this were a movie, I'd be the comic relief sidekick, not the romantic lead."

Mei giggled. "And I'd be the independent female protagonist who doesn't need a man to be happy."

The two pandas laughed, and for a moment, they forgot about the outside world and their fake relationship. It was nice to just be themselves for a change.

But then, a zookeeper came by with a tray of bamboo shoots, and Mei and Yang's peace was shattered once again. The visitors at the edge of their exhibit oohed and aahed as the pandas ate, taking pictures and videos of every bite.

Mei groaned. "Can't we just eat in peace?"

Yang shook his head. "Not when we're the stars of the show, Mei. We have to put on a good performance for our adoring fans."

Mei rolled her eyes. "Performance, my foot. All we're doing is eating bamboo. It's not exactly thrilling entertainment."

Yang chuckled. "Hey, don't knock the bamboo. It's what keeps us going in this crazy world."

Mei smiled. "I suppose you're right. At least we have each other."

Yang nodded. "Yeah, and at least we can complain about this whole fake relationship thing together."

Mei laughed. "True that. I don't know what I'd do without you, Yang."

Yang grinned. "Likewise, Mei. Even if we're not in love, we've still got each other's backs."

And with that, the two pandas went back to their bamboo, content in the knowledge that they didn't need a fake relationship to be happy. They had each other, and that was enough.
