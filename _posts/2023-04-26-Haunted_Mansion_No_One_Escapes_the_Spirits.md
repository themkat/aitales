The old mansion on the hill had always been known to be haunted. There were stories of strange noises, unexplained movements, and ghostly apparitions that appeared in the middle of the night. But no one had ever dared to investigate the mansion until now.

A group of five friends, all thrill-seekers, had decided to spend the night in the mansion to see if the stories were true. They arrived just before sunset, armed with cameras, flashlights, and a sense of adventure.

As they entered the mansion, they were immediately struck by the eerie silence that hung in the air. The mansion was old, with creaky floorboards and peeling wallpaper, but the friends were undeterred. They explored the rooms, taking pictures and making jokes about the ghosts that were supposed to inhabit the mansion.

But as the night wore on, strange things began to happen. Doors slammed shut on their own, objects moved across the room without explanation, and the temperature dropped suddenly, making the friends shiver with cold.

At first, they tried to brush it off, thinking that it was just their imagination playing tricks on them. But as the night went on, the occurrences became more and more frequent. And then they saw it â€“ a ghostly figure, standing at the end of the hallway, staring at them with empty eyes.

The friends were terrified, but they refused to leave. They were determined to capture evidence of the ghostly activity and prove to the world that the mansion was truly haunted.

As the night wore on, the ghostly activity became more and more intense. The friends heard voices whispering in their ears, felt cold hands touching their skin, and saw shadows moving across the walls.

And then, one by one, they began to disappear.

The first to go was Sarah. She had been exploring the basement when she suddenly screamed and vanished without a trace. The others searched for her, calling out her name, but she was nowhere to be found.

Next was Mike. He had been in the attic, taking pictures, when he suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned around, but no one was there. And then he was gone.

The remaining three friends were terrified. They knew that something was hunting them, something that wanted to take them one by one.

They huddled together in the living room, trying to come up with a plan. But it was too late. The ghostly figure appeared before them, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.

The friends screamed and ran, but they were no match for the ghostly presence. One by one, they were taken, disappearing into the darkness without a trace.

In the end, there was only silence. The mansion was once again empty, its ghostly inhabitants satisfied with their latest victims. And no one would ever dare to enter the mansion again, for fear of meeting the same fate as the five friends who had dared to explore its haunted halls.
