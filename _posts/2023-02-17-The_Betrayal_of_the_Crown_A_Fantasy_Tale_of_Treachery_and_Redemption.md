The winds howled through the night, sending a chill down the spine of the lone figure cloaked in shadows. His mission was simple, yet fraught with danger; infiltrate the city, locate the targets and deliver a warning. His name was Jorn, a Spy for the King, and he had been sent to uncover a betrayal that had bubbled beneath the surface of the Kingdom for too long.

Jorn had heard the rumors of a new alliance, one that threatened the power of the King. Now it was time to investigate and find out the truth. He had been told to seek out a woman by the name of Ella, who was said to be the key to uncovering the treachery.

Jorn crept through the city streets, his dark clothes masking his presence in the shadows. He came to a stop outside a small home, and he knew this was the place. He knocked on the door and waited, his heart pounding in anticipation.

The door opened and he was faced by a young woman, her eyes widening in surprise at the sight of him. He introduced himself and told her why he was there. She let him in, and as she did he could sense the fear inside her. She told him of a secret meeting she had been invited to, a meeting of those intent on overthrowing the King.

Jorn was stunned. Ella had been invited to join the rebellion, and he wondered if she had accepted. He asked her, and she shook her head, claiming she had refused their offer. He asked her why, and she told him it was because she was loyal to the King.

Jorn thanked her for her loyalty and left the house, feeling more confused than ever. He had uncovered a vast network of individuals plotting against the King, yet Ella had remained loyal. He wanted to believe her, but deep down he couldn't help but feel betrayed. 

He returned to the King's court, his mind in turmoil. He reported his findings to the King, and although he didn't mention Ella by name, the King knew. He thanked Jorn for his service and ordered him to keep an eye on Ella. Jorn reluctantly agreed, knowing that betrayal can come from even the most unexpected of sources.
