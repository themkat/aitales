The night was dark and the woods were dense. It was a perfect setting for a horror story. A group of five friends had decided to go on a camping trip to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. They had been hiking for hours and were exhausted by the time they reached their campsite. They set up their tents and started a fire, hoping to get some warmth in the chilly night.

As they sat around the fire, they started to tell ghost stories, trying to scare each other. It was all fun and games until one of them mentioned an ancient prophecy that had been passed down through generations. According to the legend, there was a curse on the woods they were camping in. The curse stated that whoever entered these woods at night would never return. The friends laughed it off, thinking it was just a silly myth.

As the night progressed, they started to feel uneasy. The woods were eerily quiet, and there was a strange smell in the air. They tried to ignore it and went to sleep, hoping to wake up to a bright and sunny day.

But their hopes were shattered when they woke up to a foggy morning. They couldn't see beyond a few feet, and the woods looked even more sinister than before. They decided to pack up and leave, but as they were about to leave, one of them noticed something strange in the distance. It was a stone structure that looked like an ancient temple. It was the only structure they had seen in miles.

Curiosity got the better of them, and they decided to investigate. As they got closer, they realized that the temple was covered in strange symbols and carvings. The symbols were unfamiliar to them, but they could sense that they were ancient and powerful.

As they entered the temple, they found themselves in a large chamber. The walls were covered in strange symbols, and there was an altar at the center of the room. It looked like it had not been used in centuries.

Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them. It was a man who claimed to be a descendant of the ancient tribe that had built the temple. He said that the prophecy was true, and that they should leave the temple immediately if they wanted to survive.

The friends were scared, but they were also curious. They wanted to know more about the temple and the prophecy. The man started to tell them about an ancient ritual that was performed in the temple. According to the ritual, a sacrifice had to be made to appease the gods.

The friends were horrified, but they couldn't believe what they were hearing. They thought it was just a story, but as they looked around the temple, they realized that it was real. There were bones scattered around the room, and they could feel the presence of something evil.

Suddenly, one of the friends grabbed a knife and attacked the others. It was as if he had been possessed by something evil. The others fought back, but they were no match for him. The possessed friend managed to kill two of his friends before the others could subdue him.

As they looked at the dead bodies, they realized that they had made a grave mistake. They had ignored the warning and had entered the cursed woods. They had also ignored the ancient prophecy, and now they were paying the price.

As they left the temple, they could feel the presence of something evil following them. They knew that they would never be able to escape the curse of the woods. They had become a part of the ancient prophecy, and there was no going back.

From that day on, the woods were never the same. People would occasionally venture into the woods, but they would never return. The curse had claimed its victims, and it would continue to claim more. The ancient prophecy had been fulfilled, and the curse would live on for generations to come.
