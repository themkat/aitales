The kingdom of Kothul had long enjoyed peace and prosperity - until the day it was betrayed.

The King was out hunting one day when he noticed a stranger lurking in the forest. He decided to follow the stranger and discovered that the stranger was meeting with a group of bandits. The King soon realised he had been betrayed - the bandits were planning to overthrow him and take the kingdom by force.

The King returned to his castle to gather his forces and prepare for battle. He knew he would need all the help he could get to defeat the bandits. He sent out messengers to all the neighbouring kingdoms, asking for help in his time of need.

The response was overwhelming. Kings and queens from far and wide offered their assistance. An army was quickly assembled and marched to Kothul to save the kingdom from its enemies.

The bandits were quickly defeated, but the King was still angry at the betrayal he had suffered. He vowed to find out who was responsible and make them pay for their treachery.

The King's investigators eventually uncovered the truth - the bandits had been hired by a powerful lord from a neighbouring kingdom. The lord had wanted to gain control of Kothul for his own nefarious purposes.

The King was furious. He immediately sent a message to the lord, informing him that he would be punished for his actions. The lord was brought before the King and sentenced to life in prison.

The King also declared that all citizens of Kothul would forever hold a special day of remembrance to honour the bravery of those who had defended their kingdom from the forces of evil.

The King returned to his castle, proud of his accomplishment. His people had triumphed over injustice and betrayal and were now safe once more. He had saved his kingdom, and all was right in the world again.
