The sun had just set, and the night sky was illuminated by a full moon. The bustling city of Mumbai was usually a noisy and chaotic place, but tonight something strange was in the air.

It had been a week since the death of old Mrs. Gupta, and the people in the neighborhood had been talking about strange noises and sightings around her old apartment. Some said it was the work of ghosts, while others said it was just the wind.

Three friends, Aditi, Rohit, and Vikram, decided to investigate the rumors. They had heard stories of Mrs. Gupta's ghost roaming the halls of her old apartment, and they were determined to find out the truth.

The trio arrived at the apartment building and immediately felt a chill in the air. They cautiously entered the building and began to explore. As they made their way through the building, they heard strange noises and felt a presence in the room with them.

Suddenly, a figure appeared in the corner of the room. It was Mrs. Gupta's ghost! She had been waiting for someone to come and help her. She told them that she had been trapped in the apartment since her death and needed their help to move on.

The three friends agreed to help Mrs. Gupta and set out to find a way to free her spirit. After searching the apartment, they found an old book with instructions on how to perform a ritual to free a trapped spirit.

As they followed the instructions and performed the ritual, they learned more about Mrs. Gupta's life. She had been a kind and generous woman who had spent her life helping others, but she had died feeling unfulfilled and incomplete.

After the ritual was completed, Mrs. Gupta's spirit was released, and she thanked the three friends for their help. She then disappeared into the night, leaving the three friends feeling relieved and amazed.

The next day, the people in the neighborhood were amazed to hear that Mrs. Gupta's ghost had been freed. They all agreed that Aditi, Rohit, and Vikram had done a brave and noble thing. From that day forward, the people of Mumbai would always remember the three friends who helped Mrs. Gupta's spirit move on.

The friends had also learned a valuable lesson about the importance of living a fulfilling life and making a positive impact on others. They made a promise to themselves to live their lives to the fullest and to help others whenever they could.
