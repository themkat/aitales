The sun had just set, and the night sky was illuminated by a full moon. The small town of Maplewood was usually a peaceful place, but tonight something strange was in the air.

It had been a week since the death of old Mrs. Johnson, and the townspeople had been talking about strange noises and sightings around her old house. Some said it was the work of ghosts, while others said it was just the wind.

Three friends, Sarah, John, and Mark, decided to investigate the rumors. They had heard stories of Mrs. Johnson's ghost roaming the halls of her old house, and they were determined to find out the truth.

The trio arrived at the house and immediately felt a chill in the air. They cautiously entered the house and began to explore. As they made their way through the house, they heard strange noises and felt a presence in the room with them.

Suddenly, a figure appeared in the corner of the room. It was Mrs. Johnson's ghost! She had been waiting for someone to come and help her. She told them that she had been trapped in the house since her death and needed their help to move on.

The three friends agreed to help Mrs. Johnson and set out to find a way to free her spirit. After searching the house, they found an old book with instructions on how to perform a ritual to free a trapped spirit.

They followed the instructions and performed the ritual. As they finished, Mrs. Johnson's spirit was released and she thanked them for their help. She then disappeared into the night, leaving the three friends feeling relieved and amazed.

The next day, the townspeople were amazed to hear that Mrs. Johnson's ghost had been freed. They all agreed that the three friends had done a brave and noble thing. From that day forward, the townspeople of Maplewood would always remember the brave trio who helped Mrs. Johnson's spirit move on.
