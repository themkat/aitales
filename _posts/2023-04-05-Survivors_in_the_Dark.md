It was a dark and stormy night, and the small group of coworkers huddled together in the break room of the office building. The power had gone out, leaving them stranded and alone in the building. They had all been working late, trying to finish up a big project, and now they were trapped.

At first, they tried to stay calm and rational. They checked their phones, but there was no signal. They tried the emergency phone in the hallway, but it was dead. They looked out the windows, but the rain was falling so hard they could barely see the parking lot.

As the hours passed, their nerves began to fray. They started to argue about what to do next. Some wanted to try to find a way out, while others thought they should stay put and wait for help. But as the night wore on, they all began to realize that they were in serious trouble.

That's when they started to hear the noises. At first, it was just a faint scratching sound, like something was trying to claw its way through the walls. Then they heard the footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing through the empty halls.

They tried to ignore it, telling themselves that it was just their imaginations. But then they heard the screams.

One of their coworkers had gone to the bathroom and never come back. They searched the building, calling out his name, but there was no answer. And then they found him, lying on the floor in a pool of blood. His throat had been torn out, and his eyes were open, staring up at them in terror.

Panic set in. They knew they had to get out of the building, but they had no idea how. The doors were all locked, and the windows were too high to reach. They tried breaking the glass, but it was too thick.

That's when they heard the growling. It was coming from the stairwell, and it was getting louder. They could hear the sound of claws scraping against the concrete steps.

They knew they were being hunted.

They huddled together, trying to stay quiet and still. But the creature found them anyway. It burst into the room, a massive, snarling beast with razor-sharp teeth and glowing red eyes.

They fought back with whatever they could find. One of them grabbed a fire extinguisher and sprayed it in the creature's face. Another grabbed a chair and swung it at the beast's head. But it was no use. The creature was too strong, too fast.

One by one, they fell. Some were ripped apart by the creature's claws, while others were bitten and dragged away. The survivors could hear their screams echoing through the halls.

And then there were only two left. They were both injured, bleeding from deep wounds. They knew they were going to die, but they didn't want to die alone.

They huddled together, holding hands, as the creature closed in on them. And then, just as it was about to strike, the power came back on.

The creature vanished, leaving behind only the bloody remains of their coworkers. The survivors stumbled out of the building, shaken and traumatized by what they had experienced.

They never spoke of it again, but they knew that they had formed a bond that would never be broken. They had faced death together, and in doing so, they had become something more than just coworkers. They were survivors.
